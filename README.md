New way of learniing

You might have identified a spelling mistake in previous sentense "learniing", there are two i's. It is to indicate that two person discussing about their learning plan. one of the i in learniing is "YOU".

After going through the book named "No Excuse", I found out that there is something to share with you,

Spend 3% of your income on you i.e on your everyday education, you you heard it correct. Everyday you should spend 2 hours on reading your engineering subject before you do your first assingment (e.g: start working at office or starting you collge assignment etc). Find out what tools, accessories, video lesson, books you need to elevate the knowledge of current subject line. Make you plan/ goal not to achieve what you want in future, but a done list which will elevate from inside. Take small steps every day to fill your done list and continue it without breaking the chain.

I have created this platform to improve my done list. It can be helpful to you also.
